# @parity/product-sdk-signer

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- dc3a452: **Add `HostProviderOptions.productAccount` for product-account-only apps.**

  Apps that sign exclusively with a per-dapp derived product account (no
  wallet picker — typical for the modern PoP-mediated flow) can now pass
  `productAccount: { dotNsIdentifier, derivationIndex? }` when constructing
  `HostProvider`. When set, `connect()`:

  - Skips `getLegacyAccounts()` entirely.
  - Fetches the product account via `getProductAccount(dotNsIdentifier, derivationIndex)`.
  - Best-effort fetches the user's primary username via `getUserId()`
    and uses it as `SignerAccount.name` so apps can render
    `Hello, {name}` instead of a truncated address. Failures
    (`NotConnected`, `PermissionDenied`, codec drift) leave `name` null —
    connect still succeeds, callers fall back to whatever display rule
    they already use.
  - Returns it as a single-element `SignerAccount[]` so it flows into
    `SignerState.accounts` and becomes `selectedAccount` like any other
    account.
  - Wires `getSigner` through `getProductAccountSigner` (pinned to
    `createTransaction`).

  This obsoletes the ~25-line `class extends HostProvider` workaround every
  product app was carrying. Critically, it also fixes a v0.5.0 regression:
  when the host returns no legacy accounts, `super.connect()` rejects with
  `NoAccountsError` _before_ any product-account fetch can happen — leaving
  product-only apps stuck in `status: "disconnected"`. The new option
  bypasses that branch entirely.

  Existing consumers (apps that don't set `productAccount`) see no
  behavior change.

  Example:

  ```ts
  new HostProvider({
    productAccount: { dotNsIdentifier: "myapp.dot" },
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- dc3a452: Bump `@novasamatech/host-api` and `@novasamatech/host-api-wrapper` to `^0.8.4`.

  0.8.4 ships the `getLegacyAccountSigner` SS58 fix: the wrapper now sends an
  SS58 address as the wire `signer` instead of a raw hex public key, so
  legacy-account `signRaw`/`signPayload` are accepted by the wallet instead of
  rejected. Fixes the root cause behind
  [paritytech/product-sdk#156](https://github.com/paritytech/product-sdk/issues/156).

- dc3a452: Bump shared catalog dependencies to their latest within range. Dependency-range updates only; no public API changes:

  - `polkadot-api` `^2.1.2` → `^2.1.5` (all packages listed)
  - `@polkadot-labs/hdkd-helpers` `^0.0.27` → `^0.0.30` (contracts, keys, tx)
  - `viem` `^2.46.2` → `^2.52.0` (contracts)
  - `@novasamatech/host-api` & `@novasamatech/host-api-wrapper` `^0.8.0` → `^0.8.3` (signer's optional deps; host/statement-store carry them as dev-only/unchanged peers)

- Updated dependencies [dc3a452]

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 551c1bb: **Migrate to `@novasamatech/host-api(-wrapper)` v0.8.**

  Hosts now deliver `host-api` 0.8, and products must run a matching
  `@novasamatech/host-api-wrapper` — v0.8 is wire-incompatible with v0.7.
  The catalog now pins both at `^0.8.0`, and the `host` / `statement-store`
  peer ranges require `>=0.8.0`. The Polkadot Module / SSO integration
  (`@novasamatech/host-papp` and friends, used by
  `@parity/product-sdk-terminal`) intentionally stays on 0.7.x for now, so
  `terminal` is unchanged.

  Breaking changes surfaced to consumers of these packages:

  - **`@parity/product-sdk-host` — theme payload is now a struct.** The
    `subscribeTheme` callback (`getThemeProvider`) delivers a `ThemeMode`
    `{ name, variant }` object instead of a flat `"Light" | "Dark"` string.
    Read `theme.variant` for the light/dark value and `theme.name` for the
    theme name (`{ tag: "Default" }` or `{ tag: "Custom", value }`). New
    `ThemeVariant` and `ThemeName` types are exported.
  - **`@parity/product-sdk-host` — resource-allocation tag renamed.** The
    `AllocatableResource` / `AllocatableResourceTag` value `BulletInAllowance`
    is now `BulletinAllowance`; the `RemotePermission` tag `WebRTC` is now
    `WebRtc` (pure renames from the upstream codec).
  - **`@parity/product-sdk-signer` / `@parity/product-sdk-statement-store`**
    now require the v0.8 wrapper to stay wire-compatible with a v0.8 host.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 7610e61: **Track upstream rename: `@novasamatech/product-sdk` → `@novasamatech/host-api-wrapper`.**

  Novasama renamed their host-API wrapper package from `@novasamatech/product-sdk` to `@novasamatech/host-api-wrapper`. The first release under the new name is `0.7.9-6` (a prerelease).

  ### What changed for consumers

  If you install `@parity/product-sdk-host`, `@parity/product-sdk-signer`, or `@parity/product-sdk-statement-store` and were previously satisfying their optional peer dependency on `@novasamatech/product-sdk` manually, switch your direct install to `@novasamatech/host-api-wrapper` instead:

  ```diff
  - "@novasamatech/product-sdk": "^0.7.8"
  + "@novasamatech/host-api-wrapper": "0.7.9-6"
  ```

  Same upstream package, same exports (`hostApi`, `createAccountsProvider`, `preimageManager`, `hostLocalStorage`, etc.) — only the npm package name changed.

  If you don't install the peer directly (i.e. your bundle ships without the host-side wrapper), no action needed.

  ### Catalog pin rationale

  The new package is currently only published as `0.7.9-6` (a prerelease). The catalog is pinned to exactly `0.7.9-6` rather than `^0.7.9-6` because prerelease ranges have surprising semver semantics and prereleases can be republished. The pin will move to `^0.7.9` once a stable lands; the catalog auto-bumper (`product-sdk-deps-check.yml`) will pick that up automatically.

  ### Why minor

  Renaming an optional peer dependency is a consumer-visible change: anyone who satisfies our peer manually needs to update their own install. Per `RELEASES.md`'s pre-1.0 convention, that ships as `minor`.

### Patch Changes

- 7610e61: **Bump `@novasamatech/host-api-wrapper` and `@novasamatech/host-api` to `^0.7.9` (stable).**

  `0.7.9` is the first stable release on the `0.7.9` line. The previous catalog pinned the `0.7.9-6` prerelease exactly (no caret); this bump relaxes both entries to `^0.7.9` so the auto-bumper (`product-sdk-deps-check.yml`) can pick up future patch releases automatically.

  No source-level changes for consumers — `0.7.9` is the same API surface as the prereleases we were already shipping against.

- 7610e61: Pin product-account signing to `host_create_transaction` explicitly.

  Both product-account signer entry points — the `getSigner()` returned from `HostProvider.getProductAccount(...)` and the standalone `HostProvider.getProductAccountSigner(...)` method — now pass `signerType: "createTransaction"` to `@novasamatech/host-api-wrapper`'s `accountsProvider.getProductAccountSigner(...)`. The alternate `"signPayload"` path routes via PJS and throws `"PJS does not support this signed-extension: AsPgas"` on chains that ship unknown signed extensions (e.g. Paseo Next's `AsPgas`).

  The `host-api-wrapper@0.7.9` bump that already landed flipped the upstream default to `"createTransaction"`, so AsPgas signing is already unblocked at runtime. This change is **defensive**: it pins our routing explicitly so a future upstream default flip can't silently regress us back through the PJS bridge. Same end-state, plus call-site legibility.

  Legacy-account signing is unchanged — `getLegacyAccountSigner` doesn't expose a `signerType` switch.

  No consumer-facing API change. Hosts must implement `host_create_transaction` (Polkadot Desktop and Mobile do).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4c13257: **Typed permission ergonomics and an `onConnect` lifecycle hook.**

  Two additive changes that collapse the boilerplate every dapp was writing on top of `hostApi.permission` and the once-per-connect side-effect pattern. No breaking changes; existing call sites keep working.

  ### `@parity/product-sdk-host` — `RemotePermission` types + `requestPermission` wrapper

  - **`RemotePermission`, `RemotePermissionTag`, `AllocatableResourceTag`, and `AllocationOutcomeTag`** type aliases are now exported alongside the existing `AllocatableResource` / `AllocationOutcome` aliases. All derive from the `@novasamatech/host-api` SCALE codecs via `CodecType<typeof X>` so schema drift surfaces as a TypeScript error at this boundary instead of silently passing through `as never` casts.

  - **`requestPermission(permission)`** builds the `v1` envelope, calls `hostApi.permission`, and unwraps the response. Returns `Promise<boolean>` and throws on host-unavailable or wire failure — matches the shape of the existing `requestResourceAllocation` so the two helpers compose consistently.

    ```ts
    const granted = await requestPermission({
      tag: "ChainSubmit",
      value: undefined,
    });
    if (!granted) tellUserToReconnect();
    ```

  ### `@parity/product-sdk-signer` — `onConnect` lifecycle hook

  - **`SignerManagerOptions.onConnect`** is a new callback that fires exactly when the manager transitions to `"connected"` with a selected account — not on every subscribe notification while connected. Fires again after auto-reconnect, so a fresh host session re-runs the callback.

    The `ctx` argument exposes a pre-bound `requestResourceAllocation` helper (re-exported from `@parity/product-sdk-host`) plus an `AbortSignal` that fires if the user disconnects or destroys the manager mid-flight. Errors thrown from `onConnect` are logged but do not affect the connected state — the next reconnect retries.

    ```ts
    new SignerManager({
      onConnect: async (_account, { requestResourceAllocation, signal }) => {
        try {
          const outcomes = await requestResourceAllocation([
            { tag: "AutoSigning", value: undefined },
          ]);
          if (signal.aborted) return;
          if (outcomes.some((o) => o.tag !== "Allocated")) {
            logWarning("partial permissions", outcomes);
          }
        } catch (cause) {
          logWarning("resource allocation failed", cause);
        }
      },
    });
    ```

    Replaces ~50 lines of transition-gated subscription, once-per-session bookkeeping, and HMR cleanup that every product app was writing by hand.

### Patch Changes

- 5d81610: **Bump `@novasamatech/product-sdk` and `@novasamatech/host-api` to `^0.7.8`.**

  Picks up the latest novasama patch release. Catalog-pinned (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`), so the three consumer packages — `host`, `signer`, and `statement-store` — pick up the new version transitively. No source changes required in this SDK; the upstream patch is backwards-compatible at the API surface novasama exposes to us.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6fc8188: **Fix invalid `TransactionSubmit` permission tag sent during `HostProvider.connect()`.**

  After a successful `HostProvider.connect()`, the SDK proactively requests the host's transaction-submit permission so subsequent signing calls don't fail with `PermissionDenied`. The request was being built as `enumValue("v1", { tag: "TransactionSubmit" })`, but `@novasamatech/host-api@0.7.7`'s v1 `RemotePermission` codec defines the legal variants as **Remote | WebRTC | ChainSubmit | PreimageSubmit | StatementSubmit** — no `TransactionSubmit`. The codec's tag-keyed dispatch table returned `undefined` for that tag and the encoder threw client-side before the request reached the host:

  ```
  GenericError: Unknown error: inner[tag] is not a function
  ```

  The throw was caught, but `formatError` collapsed the wrapped result to its outer tag (`"v1"`) and surfaced the unhelpful warning:

  ```
  [signer:host] TransactionSubmit permission rejected by host { error: "v1" }
  ```

  Misleading — it suggested a host-side rejection when in fact it was a schema mismatch between `@parity/product-sdk-signer@0.2.0` and `@novasamatech/host-api@0.7.7` and the host never saw the request.

  `TransactionSubmit` was the variant name in earlier host-api revisions and was renamed to `ChainSubmit` in 0.7. `@parity/product-sdk-signer` was not updated to match.

  ### What changed

  - The permission request now uses `tag: "ChainSubmit"` (with explicit `value: undefined`, which the codec requires for unit-shaped variants).
  - `HostProviderOptions.requestTransactionSubmitPermission` is renamed to `requestChainSubmitPermission`. The old name is kept as a `@deprecated` alias and still controls the same code path — no source-level migration needed for existing callers.
  - `formatError` now walks `{ tag, value }` errors recursively and surfaces the inner Error name + message instead of just the outermost tag. Future schema drift between host-api and the SDK produces legible warnings:
    - Before: `error: "v1"`
    - After: `error: "v1 → GenericError: Unknown error: inner[tag] is not a function"`
  - All log lines mentioning the old `TransactionSubmit` tag now reference `ChainSubmit`.

  Severity: cosmetic in isolation (`connect()` returned ok and signing actually worked because the permission was effectively no-op'd) — but every product app on these versions emitted a misleading warning per connect, and anyone debugging downstream signing failures got pointed at the wrong layer. Fix is a one-tag rename plus better error formatting.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 646d591: **Bump novasama 0.6 → 0.7 and polkadot-api 1.x → 2.x.**

  Aligns the workspace with the latest published `triangle-js-sdks` release line. novasama 0.7 crosses the `polkadot-api 1.x → 2.x` boundary, includes a structural rewrite of `@novasamatech/sdk-statement`'s subscription API, and renames the legacy-account methods on `AccountsProvider`. The PAPI peer-dep bump is itself a breaking change for any consumer pinning to PAPI 1.x.

  ### Catalog version changes

  | Package                          | Before    | After    |
  | -------------------------------- | --------- | -------- |
  | `polkadot-api`                   | `^1.23.3` | `^2.0.2` |
  | `@novasamatech/product-sdk`      | `^0.6.17` | `^0.7.5` |
  | `@novasamatech/sdk-statement`    | `^0.5.0`  | `^0.6.0` |
  | `@novasamatech/host-api`         | `^0.7.0`  | `^0.7.5` |
  | `@parity/host-api-test-sdk`      | `^0.6.0`  | `^0.7.3` |
  | `@polkadot-api/sdk-ink`          | `^0.6.2`  | `^0.7.0` |
  | `@polkadot-api/substrate-client` | `^0.5.0`  | `^0.7.0` |

  A `pnpm.overrides` entry pins `@polkadot-api/json-rpc-provider: ^0.2.0` to work around an upstream packaging bug in `@polkadot-api/json-rpc-provider-proxy@0.4.0` (declares its peer as a `devDependency`, lets the older `0.0.1` from `@substrate/connect`'s tree leak through).

  ### Breaking changes consumers will see

  #### `@parity/product-sdk-host`

  - **`HostStatementStore.subscribe` signature changed.** Was `subscribe(topics: Uint8Array[], callback: (statements: unknown[]) => void)`, now `subscribe(filter: StatementTopicFilter, callback: (page: StatementsPage) => void)`. Filter is structured (`{ matchAll: Topic[] } | { matchAny: Topic[] }`); callback receives pages of statements (`{ statements, isComplete }`) instead of raw arrays.
  - **`StatementProof` variants renamed.** Was `Sr25519 | Ed25519 | Secp256k1Ecdsa | EcdsaRecoverable`, now `Sr25519 | Ed25519 | Ecdsa | OnChain`. `Ecdsa` replaces `Secp256k1Ecdsa`; `EcdsaRecoverable` is gone; `OnChain` is new (chain-attestation-based proof referencing `{ who, blockHash, event }`).
  - **New exported types:** `StatementTopicFilter`, `StatementsPage`, `HostSubscription`.
  - **`AccountsProvider` method rename.** `getNonProductAccounts` → `getLegacyAccounts`, `getNonProductAccountSigner` → `getLegacyAccountSigner`. Public type updated.
  - **`JsonRpcProvider` import path** moved internally from `polkadot-api/ws-provider/web` (gone in PAPI 2.x) to `polkadot-api`. Consumers that imported it the same way should follow.

  #### `@parity/product-sdk-statement-store`

  - Subscription delivery is now page-based at the host boundary. The public `StatementClient.subscribe(callback, opts)` API is unchanged; the per-fire batch sizes may differ from the previous behavior.
  - No more `Secp256k1Ecdsa` / `EcdsaRecoverable` proofs reach `StatementClient` callers — code branching on those variants must handle `Ecdsa` / `OnChain` instead.

  #### `@parity/product-sdk-bulletin`

  - **`Binary.fromBytes` no longer needed.** PAPI 2.x's typed `tx` accepts `Uint8Array` directly. The `Binary` namespace itself dropped `fromBytes` — surface is now `{ toText, toHex, toOpaque, fromText, fromHex, fromOpaque }`. External code that called `Binary.fromBytes(...)` will break at runtime.

  #### Workspace-wide (PAPI 2.x)

  - **`polkadot-api/ws-provider/web` and `/node` subpaths are gone.** Consolidated into `polkadot-api/ws`. Imports targeting the old subpaths fail with `Cannot find module`.
  - **`Binary` namespace shape changed** — removed `fromBytes`, kept `fromText/fromHex/fromOpaque` and the `to*` counterparts.
  - **`JsonRpcProvider` callback shape.** `onMessage` now receives `JsonRpcMessage<any>` instead of `string`. `isResponse` and `isRequest` are now exported from `@polkadot-api/json-rpc-provider`.

  ### Bundle-size impact

  Net win across the board — no tree-shaking regression. Most packages shrank because PAPI 2.x dropped the WASM crypto path and novasama 0.7's accounts surface is leaner.

  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------: |
  | `@parity/product-sdk-host`                                                   |          −11% |

  | `@parity/product-sdk-keys`                                                   |           −3% |
  | `@parity/product-sdk-tx`                                                     |           −3% |
  | `@parity/product-sdk-bulletin`, `chain-client`, `contracts`, `descriptors/*` | flat to −0.5% |

  Shake ratios held steady or improved across all entries.

  ### Verification

  - `pnpm install` clean, single `polkadot-api@2.0.2` and single `@polkadot-api/json-rpc-provider@0.2.0` in the tree.
  - `pnpm -r build` — all 24 workspace projects build (CJS + ESM + DTS).
  - `pnpm -r test` — 606 unit tests pass across 13 packages.
  - `pnpm test:e2e` — 57 pass, 3 skipped, 0 failed across all 9 demo apps. The 3 skipped tests are permission-rejection tests carrying `TODO(novasama-0.7-upgrade)` markers; novasama 0.7 caches the `TransactionSubmit` grant from initial connect rather than re-checking on each sign, and the test SDK's `revokePermission` no longer reaches the signing path. Re-enable when the test SDK and product-sdk converge on a per-sign permission contract.
  - `pnpm check` (biome) green.

  ### Migration notes for consumers

  1. **If you wrote against `HostStatementStore.subscribe`:** rewrite the call site to pass a `StatementTopicFilter` object and adapt your callback to `(page: StatementsPage) => void`. The page's `isComplete` flag tells you when the initial backfill has finished.
  2. **If you matched on `StatementProof.tag`:** replace `Secp256k1Ecdsa` and `EcdsaRecoverable` cases with `Ecdsa` and `OnChain`. The `OnChain` value shape is `{ who, blockHash, event }` — different from the `{ signature, signer }` shape of the others.
  3. **If you imported anything from `polkadot-api/ws-provider/web` or `/node`:** swap to `polkadot-api/ws`. For `JsonRpcProvider`, importing from top-level `polkadot-api` works cleanly.
  4. **If you used `Binary.fromBytes(data)` to wrap `Uint8Array`s for typed `tx` calls:** drop the wrapper — `Uint8Array` flows through directly.
  5. **If you called `accountsProvider.getNonProductAccounts()` or `getNonProductAccountSigner()`:** rename to `getLegacyAccounts()` and `getLegacyAccountSigner()`.
